Cyclists new to Seattle face difficulties finding appropriate bike rides for sightseeing. Currently, most people spend much time searching the information of bike rides online, but the information might be incomplete or even incorrect. Another option for them is to buy guidebooks, but these books can be expensive, outdated and heavy to carry.
